	<p>My favourite anime of all time, and one that has influenced me majorly throughout my life: Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Animated by legendary Studio TRIGGER-predecessor Studio Gainax, this mecha anime is the perfect essence of the "Super Robot" subgenre compacted down into an amazing, dense, hot-blooded package. Filled to the brim with beautiful action animation, iconic mechanical designs, memorable characters, and unique music, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is an absolute delight to both the eyes and ears. However, beyond the passionate yelling and cool robot battles, TTGL also has plenty of inspirational messages about believing in yourself, the importance of constant self improvement, the human desire for freedom, the strength of bonds, and the potential of humanity. <br>
	Gurren Lagann has always been a source of inspiration for me ever since I saw it as a child, and continues to motivate me to this day. It is a gracefully crafted work of art with a profound message and I cannot speak enough of how much I love it.

	<img src="Yotsuba&-vol1cover-jp.png" width="241" height="352" class="center" alt="yotsubato"/> 
	<p>Yotsuba&! (pronounced Yotsubato) is a manga by Kiyohiko Azuma about the daily life of a five year old girl named Yotsuba who lives with her single father, Yousuke Koiwai. Yotsuba is an extremely curious child who loves to explore and learn, and manages to find joy in everything in life. <br>
	Sounds kinda boring, doesn't it? But hear me out. Yotsubato! is a charming and cute manga that shows the world through the lense of an innocent child who only wants to have fun. With how stressful adult life is on a day-to-day basis, it's easy to become negative and pessimistic. Yotsubato! reminds us how to find joy in even the smallest, most mundane things like seeing pretty rocks at the beach or going to the store with a loved one. The message of the manga can be shown through its two slogans: "Enjoy everything." and "Today is the most enjoyable day". </p>
